#Image Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition. CNNs are particularly effective for tasks like image classification due to their ability to learn spatial hierarchies of features directly from pixel images.


Features
CNN Architecture: Utilizes a custom CNN architecture suitable for image recognition tasks.
Dataset: Uses [Dataset Name] consisting of [Number] images across [Number] classes.
Preprocessing: Includes preprocessing steps such as normalization, augmentation (if applicable), and resizing.
Training: Trains the CNN model on GPU/CPU using [Framework] for efficient computation.
Evaluation: Evaluates model performance on a separate test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Potential for deployment on edge devices or cloud platforms depending on hardware and latency requirements.
Requirements
[Python Version]: Python 3.x
[Framework/Library]: Specify libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.
